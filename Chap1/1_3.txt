Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

1. if two strings with different length, return False

2. if two strings are identical, is it True??

3. Use set, two set must have same length and same elements

this might be wrong, 
aab, abb
This condition is wrong

4. sort both of them, and compare these two sorted strings. 

5. hints from the book
are the strings case sensitive??
how about white spaces??

6. Implementation in java
public class Solution(){
	public String sort(String str){

	}
	public boolean isPermutations(String s1, String s2){
	
	}
}
