Implement a function void reverse (char* str) in C or C++ which reverses a null-terminated string.

1. Find the end point of the string, and swap them one by one.

2. //end is the last char in str
while (str < end){
	temp = *str;
	*str = *end;
	*end = temp;
	str++;
	end--;
}

3. One thing to remember, str might be null
